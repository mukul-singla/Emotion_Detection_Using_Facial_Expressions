# Emotion Detection Using NLP and Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting emotions from text data using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The Jupyter notebook provides an end-to-end implementation of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation for emotion detection.

## Project Overview

Emotion detection is a significant task in sentiment analysis and human-computer interaction. This project employs machine learning algorithms and NLP techniques to classify text data into various emotional categories.


## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, cleaning, and feature extraction.
- **Model Training**: Uses machine learning algorithms for training.
- **Evaluation**: Model performance metrics and visualizations.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python installed. Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
